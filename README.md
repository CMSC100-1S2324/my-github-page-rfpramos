Steps on how to create GitHub page:

    On the repository, click on settings.
    
    Then on the left tab under Code and Automation, Choose pages.
    
    After that, choose which branch you are going to deploy (for me, main).
    
    Voila! Done.

What are your key takeaways from this exercise?
    
    I have been coding websites in the past but I have never really given the concept of "Order of Presedence" that much attention. For this exercise, my main takeway was how useful it is on reusing designs I implemented to in other class to a new class with "minor changes". I see this concept just like how I had utilized method overriding in OOP. Very useful!


Developer note: When I was having an issue with connecting to git, I worked on my project remotely (i.e., on my terminal, not connected). To wit, I reset my progress by clearing my repo and started developing again while integrating what I had intially done.
I have used large files for my assets. It takes time to load.
